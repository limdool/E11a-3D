# E11a-3D
Today, I made my first 3D game by using Godot. I forked and cloned the repository given on Canvas. Next, I opened Godot and imported the file. I watched and followed along with the videos on Canvas, which taught me how to work on the project. They taught me everything in details, such as downloading specific files from specific website. After following along with the films, I finished working on the project. I saved it and checked if it works properly. Luckily, it workd fine. Finally, I edited README.md and LICENSE. 

* I used the following links for working on the project.
